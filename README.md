# MilitaryUnit
Using inheritance, abstraction, classes, and objects, implement a military unit. Create super or abstract classes representing several components of a military unit. Examples might include personnel, weapons, equipment, vehicles, missions, etc. Each parent class should be subclassed several times. Thinking about test-first development, you may want to write the main program first, before you create any other classes or objects. That way, you can create classes with the appropriate properties and methods, and instantiate objects as needed to carry out the mission.
